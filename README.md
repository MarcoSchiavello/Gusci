<h1 align="center" text-allign="center"><img src="https://github.com/MarcoSchiavello/Gusci/blob/master/img/icon.png" style="width: 50px" /> Gusci</h1> 

It was the first web development project in 2019, created to improve my skills in new programming languages such as PHP, SQL, and JS.
The site is a very basic e-commerce that wants to meme the famous luxury brand Gucci by slightly modifying the name into "Gusci"

## Install
To install and run the site, you have to host the project on a web server, locally i.e. `XAMPP`  / `LAMPP` or ecc.. 
or remotely with a hosting platform like `Altervista.org` or `Render.com`.
Ether ways you want to put the code in the `htdocs/` directory and run a MySQL server 

## Tech-stack
